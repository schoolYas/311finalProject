The following code was written by Yasamean Zaidi-Dozandeh

Firstly, the base source files for Index, JedisIndex, JedisMaker, TermCounter, WikiFetcher, WikiNodeIterable, WikiSearch,
and WikiSearchTest were taken from Think Data Structures github repository for Excercise 13 in Chapter 16. 

Then, the README file and gitignore file was created. The gitignore was copied from a previous assignment and the Markdown file 
written from scratch. 

The build file was written by taking a build file from Assignment 11 as reference to add in file paths for any other files. 

Then the missing methods of the source files related to WikiSearch were re-completed using previous code from previous homework assignments. 

Finally, the Redis Client was set up and astyle was implemented. There may be some empty commits that were done unintentionally while dealing with a git fatality and issues with the jedis jar file.
